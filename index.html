        <p class="prod-overview-paragraph">Inkjet printing technology uses miniscule, liquid ink droplets that
            are propelled onto paper or other substrates during the printing process,
            where they rapidly dry to produce high-quality, high-resolution colorful
            text and images.
        </p>
        <p class="prod-overview-paragraph">Dye-based inks are less expensive. They are able to produce more
            vibrant colors when printing as the ink is absorbed into the fiber of the material.
            Dye-based inks are more reslient when printing. The ink sits on the surface of
            the material it is printed on and fuses with the fibers. Pigment-based ink is ideal
            for printing durable labels, such as GHS and BS 5609 compliant labels.
        </p>
        <p class="prod-overview-paragraph">
            Inkjet printing supports roll and fanfold labels, as well as tags.
            Roll labels must have 3" core innter diameter. Perforated or non-perforated
            labels can be used as well as continuous labels. Many inkjet printers
            support labels with glossy or matte finished for applications that requre
            different vibrancy or reflectivity levels. We carry various label sizes in
            different materials and colors to ensure you are choosing the best
            label for your application.
